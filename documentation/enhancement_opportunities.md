2. **Implement in incremental phases**
   - Develop core functionality first, then add advanced features
   - Release improvements as they become available rather than waiting for all features
   - Gather feedback after each phase to inform subsequent development

3. **Focus on integration points**
   - Ensure new features work seamlessly with existing components
   - Create clear interfaces between systems
   - Maintain backward compatibility where possible

4. **Emphasize testing and documentation**
