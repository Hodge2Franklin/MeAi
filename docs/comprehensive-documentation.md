### Core Layer
- Event System: Facilitates communication between components
- Storage Manager: Handles persistent data storage
- System Integration Manager: Coordinates initialization and interaction between components

### Conversation Layer
- Advanced NLU System: Processes and understands natural language input
- Context Awareness System: Maintains conversation context
- Sentiment Analysis System: Detects emotional tone in messages
- Topic Modeling System: Identifies and tracks conversation topics
- Long-term Memory System: Stores and retrieves important information

### Presentation Layer
- 3D Visualization: Renders visual representation of MeAI
- Enhanced User Interface: Provides intuitive interaction methods
- Theme System: Manages visual appearance and customization
- Accessibility System: Ensures usability for all users

### Audio Layer
- Spatial Audio System: Creates immersive audio experience
- Voice Recognition: Processes spoken input
- Voice Synthesis: Generates natural-sounding speech output

### Utility Layer

- Multi-language Support: Enables internationalization
- Offline Support: Provides functionality without internet connection

## Core Components

### Event System
The Event System implements a publish-subscribe pattern that allows components to communicate without direct dependencies. Components can publish events and subscribe to events from other components.

```javascript
// Publishing an event
eventSystem.publish('user-message', { text: 'Hello, MeAI!' });

// Subscribing to an event
eventSystem.subscribe('user-message', (data) => {
    // Handle the event
    console.log('Received message:', data.text);
});
```

### Storage Manager
The Storage Manager provides a unified interface for persistent storage using IndexedDB. It handles data serialization, versioning, and migration.

```javascript
// Storing data
await storageManager.setIndexedDB('conversations', {
    id: 'conversation-123',
    messages: [/* message objects */]
});

// Retrieving data
const conversation = await storageManager.getIndexedDB('conversations', 'conversation-123');
```

### System Integration Manager
The System Integration Manager coordinates the initialization and interaction of all MeAI components. It ensures that components are initialized in the correct order and handles dependency management.

```javascript
// Initializing the system
const integrationManager = new SystemIntegrationManager();
await integrationManager.initialize();

// Getting system status
const status = await integrationManager.getSystemStatus();
```

## Advanced Natural Language Understanding

The Advanced NLU System enhances MeAI's ability to understand and respond to natural language input. It consists of several interconnected components:

### Context Awareness System
The Context Awareness System maintains the conversation context and helps MeAI understand references and follow conversation threads. It tracks:

- Entities mentioned in the conversation
- User preferences and interests
- Conversation history and flow
- Current conversation topic

The system uses a hierarchical context model with short-term, medium-term, and long-term context layers.

### Sentiment Analysis System
The Sentiment Analysis System detects the emotional tone in user messages and adjusts MeAI's responses accordingly. It can identify:

- Basic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise)
- Intensity of emotions
- Changes in emotional state over time
- Sarcasm and humor (with limitations)

The system uses a combination of lexical analysis, pattern matching, and machine learning techniques.

### Topic Modeling System
The Topic Modeling System identifies and tracks conversation topics, allowing MeAI to maintain coherent conversations and provide relevant information. It features:

- Dynamic topic identification
- Topic clustering and categorization
- Interest tracking based on topic engagement
- Topic switching detection

The system uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and other statistical methods to identify topics.

## Enhanced User Experience

The Enhanced User Experience system improves MeAI's usability and engagement through several features:

### Intuitive Onboarding Process
The onboarding process guides new users through MeAI's features and capabilities. It includes:

- Interactive tutorials
- Feature discovery
- Personalization options
- Progress tracking

The onboarding adapts to the user's experience level and interaction patterns.

### User Feedback Mechanisms
The feedback system collects and processes user feedback to improve MeAI's performance. It includes:

- Explicit feedback collection (ratings, comments)
- Implicit feedback tracking (engagement metrics)
- Feedback analysis and categorization
- Response adaptation based on feedback

### Customizable Conversation Flows
Users can customize how conversations with MeAI flow and progress. Features include:

- Conversation style preferences
- Topic interest configuration
- Response length and detail level settings
- Conversation memory settings

## Performance Optimization

The Performance Optimization system ensures MeAI runs smoothly across different devices and network conditions:

### Resource Management
The system monitors and manages system resources to prevent performance degradation:

- Memory usage tracking and optimization
- CPU utilization monitoring
- FPS measurement for animation performance
- Automatic quality adjustments based on device capabilities

### Adaptive Loading
Content and features are loaded adaptively based on device capabilities and network conditions:

- Device capability detection
- Network condition monitoring
- Quality level adjustment (low, medium, high, ultra)
- Feature prioritization based on user preferences

### Progressive Loading
The system implements progressive loading to improve initial interaction times:

- Core functionality loaded first
- Non-essential features loaded in background
- Loading stage management
- Progress indication

## System Integration

The System Integration Manager ensures all components work together seamlessly:

### Initialization Management
Components are initialized in the correct order with dependency resolution:

- Required systems initialized first
- Optional systems initialized in parallel
- Timeout handling for initialization
- Error recovery strategies

### Inter-component Communication
The Event System facilitates communication between components:

- Standardized event format
- Event prioritization
- Event filtering
- Error handling for event processing

### State Management
The system maintains a consistent state across components:

- Centralized state storage
- State change notifications
- State synchronization
- State persistence
