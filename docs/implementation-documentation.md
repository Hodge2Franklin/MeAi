  x: 1, y: 0, z: -2,
  volume: 0.7,
  loop: false,
  autoplay: true
});

// Create an ambient soundscape
const soundscape = await spatialAudioSystem.createAmbientSoundscape('forest', {
  baseUrl: 'audio/forest/',
  layers: [
    { file: 'ambient_base.mp3', volume: 0.5 },
    { file: 'birds.mp3', volume: 0.3 }
  ],
  accents: [
    { file: 'bird_call.mp3', minInterval: 5, maxInterval: 15 }
  ]
});

// Set audio environment
await spatialAudioSystem.setEnvironment('large-room');

// Adjust audio for emotional state
spatialAudioSystem.adjustAudioForEmotionalState('joy', 0.8);
