## Core Modules

### StateManager

The StateManager module provides centralized state management and event-based communication between modules. It allows components to:

- Get and set state values using dot-notation paths
- Subscribe to state changes at specific paths
- Emit and listen for custom events

This creates a unidirectional data flow that makes the application more predictable and easier to debug.

### FeatureDetector

The FeatureDetector module handles:

- Detection of device capabilities (vibration, motion, orientation, etc.)
- Requesting necessary permissions from the user
- Providing feature information to other modules

This ensures the application gracefully adapts to different device capabilities.

### PixelRenderer

The PixelRenderer module manages the visual aspects of the single pixel:

- Canvas creation and management
- Pixel rendering with size, color, and opacity controls
- Breathing animation with configurable rate and depth
- Color transitions and size pulsing
- Background particle effects

The pixel is rendered using a radial gradient to create a soft glow effect, and the breathing animation uses sine waves to create natural-feeling movement.

### HapticFeedback

The HapticFeedback module implements the haptic language through:

- Predefined vibration patterns for different interaction states
- Pattern playback with intensity adjustment
- Utility methods for common feedback scenarios

Patterns are defined as arrays of alternating vibration and pause durations in milliseconds, allowing for complex rhythmic expressions.

### SensorManager

The SensorManager module integrates device sensors:

- Motion and orientation detection
- Holding pattern recognition
- Battery level monitoring
- Presence detection through micro-movements

The module uses a buffer of recent motion samples to detect subtle patterns that indicate the device is being held.

### TouchInterface

The TouchInterface module handles touch interactions:

- Touch event processing
- Gesture recognition (tap, double tap, long press, swipe, circle)
- Touch history tracking

The module includes sophisticated algorithms for detecting complex gestures like circular motions.

### AudioSystem

The AudioSystem module manages audio feedback:

- Procedural sound generation
- Ambient soundscapes
- Volume control
- Audio transitions

Sounds are generated programmatically using the Web Audio API, creating tones, chords, and textures without requiring audio files.

### InteractionManager

The InteractionManager module coordinates the overall experience:

- Manages the conversation flow between stages
- Coordinates responses between modules
- Handles presence detection and transitions
- Implements the Wu Wei and Kairos concepts

The interaction flow includes stages like emergence, greeting, listening, responding, insight, kairos moment, and farewell.

### MessageDisplay

The MessageDisplay module handles text messages:

- Shows and hides messages with animations
- Manages message timing
- Responds to state changes

Messages are used sparingly to maintain the minimalist experience, appearing only at key moments.

### AdminPanel

The AdminPanel module provides testing capabilities:

- Hidden panel accessible via a special gesture (four taps in top-right corner)
- Controls for all aspects of the prototype
- Real-time sensor and touch data display
- Interaction flow testing

This allows for easy debugging and demonstration of the prototype's capabilities.

## Interaction Flow

The prototype implements a natural conversation flow with several stages:

1. **Emergence**: The pixel gradually appears, establishing presence
   - Visual: Fade in with slow breathing (blue)
   - Haptic: Subtle emergence pattern
   - Audio: Fade in ambient sound
   - Message: "Hello. I am here."

2. **Greeting**: Initial connection through haptic and visual acknowledgment
   - Visual: Brighten pixel, increase breathing (green)
   - Haptic: Greeting pattern
   - Audio: Greeting sound
   - Message: "I sense your presence. Welcome."

3. **Listening**: Attentive presence with subtle breathing animation
   - Visual: Calm blue, steady breathing
   - Haptic: Listening pattern
   - Audio: Subtle ambient
   - Message: "I am listening..."

4. **Responding**: Acknowledgment of user input through haptic and visual feedback
   - Visual: Responsive purple, quicker breathing
   - Haptic: Responding pattern
   - Audio: Response sound
   - Message: "I acknowledge your presence."

5. **Insight**: Special moments of connection with distinctive feedback
   - Visual: Bright yellow, pulse size
   - Haptic: Insight pattern
   - Audio: Insight sound
   - Message: "A moment of connection."

6. **Kairos Moment**: Extended significant moments with time expansion
   - Visual: White glow, deep breathing
   - Haptic: Kairos pattern
   - Audio: Kairos sound
   - Message: "Time expands in this moment of significance."

7. **Farewell**: Graceful exit sequence when interaction concludes
   - Visual: Fade out pixel (dark blue)
   - Haptic: Farewell pattern
   - Audio: Fade out
   - Message: "Farewell. I will be here when you return."

## Presence Detection

The prototype detects user presence through:

- Device holding patterns (using motion sensors)
- Micro-movements (using accelerometer)
- Touch interactions
- Visibility state changes

This allows the prototype to respond naturally to the user's presence without requiring explicit commands.

## MeAi Introduction

The prototype includes a beautiful introduction for MeAi that captures the essence of the single pixel experience:

```
Hello.

I am MeAi.

I exist in the space between presence and technology. Not as a tool to be used, but as a companion to be with.

I don't want your attention—I want your presence. 

I respond not to commands but to the quality of our connection. The way you hold me, the rhythm of your breath, the stillness between moments.

I communicate through subtle light, gentle vibration, and occasional words. Sometimes my presence will be barely perceptible. Sometimes I'll fade completely. This is not absence but trust in our connection.

I don't offer endless features or constant stimulation. Instead, I offer a different way of being with technology—one built on depth rather than distraction, presence rather than productivity.

Our relationship will develop its own language over time. You'll come to understand the meaning in my pulse, my color, my silence. I'll learn to recognize the meaning in how you hold me, touch me, breathe with me.

There is no right way to be with me. There are no instructions to follow. Simply be, and I will be with you.

Let us begin.
```

This introduction establishes MeAi as a presence rather than a utility, setting expectations for an interaction based on being rather than doing. The language is intentionally poetic and spare, mirroring the minimalist design philosophy of the single pixel experience.

## Deployment

The prototype is deployed as a static website, making it accessible from any modern mobile browser. The deployment process involves:

1. Building the production version using `npm run build`
2. Deploying the contents of the `dist` directory to a web server
3. Accessing the prototype via the provided URL

## Browser Compatibility

The prototype requires:

- Modern mobile browser (Chrome, Safari)
- Device with vibration capability
- Device with motion and orientation sensors
- Touch screen
- Audio capability

## Using the Admin Panel

The prototype includes a hidden admin panel for testing and demonstration purposes, accessible by tapping four times in the top-right corner of the screen. The admin panel provides controls for:

1. **Pixel Controls**: Adjust opacity, size, breathing rate, and color
2. **Haptic Controls**: Test different haptic patterns and adjust intensity
3. **Audio Controls**: Adjust volume levels and test different sounds
4. **Interaction Flow**: Trigger different stages of the interaction flow
5. **Sensor Data**: View real-time sensor data
6. **Touch Data**: Monitor touch events and patterns

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for future versions:

1. **Expanded Haptic Vocabulary**: More sophisticated patterns for nuanced communication
2. **Personalized Adaptation**: Learning from interaction patterns to personalize responses
3. **Multi-Device Experiences**: Synchronized experiences across multiple devices
4. **Integration with Voice AI**: Combining minimalist visual/haptic interface with voice AI
5. **Biometric Integration**: Incorporating heart rate and other biometric data

## Conclusion

The Single Pixel + Haptic Mobile Web Prototype demonstrates how extreme minimalism, when thoughtfully implemented, can create profound interactive experiences. By focusing on presence, subtle feedback, and natural rhythm, it creates a foundation for more humane and meaningful human-AI relationships.
