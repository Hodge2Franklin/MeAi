# MeAI Next Development Priorities

Based on the comprehensive development roadmap, the following features have been identified as the highest priorities for immediate implementation:

## 1. 3D Pixel Visualization

The current pixel visualization system will be enhanced with WebGL-based 3D rendering to create a more immersive and expressive visual representation of MeAI.

### Implementation Tasks
- Set up WebGL rendering context
- Create 3D models for each emotional state
- Implement smooth transitions between 3D states
- Optimize performance for various devices
- Add lighting and shadow effects
- Integrate with existing emotion detection system

### Technical Approach
- Use Three.js for WebGL implementation
- Create low-polygon models for optimal performance
- Implement GLSL shaders for visual effects
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Add fallback to 2D for unsupported browsers

## 2. Long-term Memory Architecture

The current contextual memory system will be enhanced with a more sophisticated long-term memory architecture that persists across sessions and provides more intelligent recall.

### Implementation Tasks
- Design database schema for memory storage
- Implement importance-based memory retention
- Create memory retrieval algorithms based on context
- Develop memory consolidation processes
- Add memory visualization for users
- Implement privacy controls for stored memories

### Technical Approach
- Use IndexedDB for client-side storage
- Implement memory importance scoring algorithm
- Create fuzzy matching for memory retrieval
- Use Web Workers for background memory processing
- Add encryption for sensitive memory data

## 3. Spatial Audio System

The current multi-layered ambient system will be enhanced with spatial audio capabilities to create a more immersive audio experience.

### Implementation Tasks
- Implement 3D audio positioning
- Create directional sound sources
- Develop room acoustics simulation
- Add audio occlusion and obstruction
- Create audio zones with different characteristics
- Implement distance-based audio attenuation

### Technical Approach
- Use Web Audio API's PannerNode for spatial positioning
- Implement custom convolution reverb for room acoustics
- Create dynamic audio routing graph
- Use AudioParam automation for smooth transitions
- Implement audio worklets for custom processing

## 4. Advanced User Profiles

The current user personalization system will be enhanced with more comprehensive user profiles that adapt to user preferences and behaviors.

### Implementation Tasks
- Design expanded user preference schema
- Implement interest and topic tracking
- Develop adaptive user interfaces
- Add cross-device profile synchronization
- Create preference learning algorithms
- Implement user behavior analytics

### Technical Approach
- Use structured JSON for profile storage
- Implement machine learning for preference prediction
- Create secure profile synchronization mechanism
- Use local storage with encryption for sensitive data
- Develop modular UI components that adapt to preferences
