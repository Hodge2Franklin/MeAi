# MeAI Release Notes

## Version 3.0.0 (April 4, 2025)

### Major Features

#### Advanced Animation System
- **3D Pixel Visualization**: Implemented WebGL-based 3D rendering with Three.js for immersive visual representation with depth and perspective.
- **Advanced Particle Effects**: Created sophisticated particle systems with physics-based behavior, emotion-specific effects, and interactive responses to user input.
- **Physics-Based Animations**: Implemented realistic motion using physics simulation with forces, constraints, and natural movement patterns.
- **Procedural Animation Generation**: Developed algorithm-driven animation sequences that create unique, non-repeating animations with context-aware variations.
- **Post-Processing Effects**: Added bloom, color grading, and emotional state-based visual effects for enhanced visual quality.

#### Long-term Memory Architecture
- **Persistent Storage**: Implemented IndexedDB-based storage for conversation history that persists across sessions.
- **Importance-Based Memory Retention**: Created sophisticated algorithms that retain important information while gradually forgetting less relevant details.
- **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Developed advanced retrieval mechanisms that surface relevant memories based on conversation context.
- **Memory Visualization**: Added interactive visualization of memory structures with multiple view types and filtering options.

#### Spatial Audio System
- **3D Audio Positioning**: Implemented spatial audio using Web Audio API's PannerNode for immersive sound experience.
- **Environmental Effects**: Created customizable reverb and acoustic spaces that adapt to emotional states.
- **Multi-layered Ambient Soundscapes**: Enhanced the existing ambient system with spatial characteristics and dynamic adjustments.
- **Interaction Sound Positioning**: Added directional sound for interaction feedback with distance-based attenuation.

#### Advanced User Profiles
- **Multi-User Support**: Implemented profile switching for different users with separate preferences.
- **Preference Learning**: Created machine learning models that adapt to user behavior and detect preferences automatically.
- **Interest and Topic Tracking**: Developed systems to track user interests and adjust responses accordingly.
- **Enhanced Personalization**: Added comprehensive preference categories for visual, audio, conversation, and accessibility settings.

### Infrastructure Improvements
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented adaptive quality settings based on device capabilities with FPS monitoring.
- **Repository Management**: Established structured git repository with proper branching strategy and backup procedures.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Added detailed documentation for all new systems, including the Advanced Animation System.
- **Thread Persistence**: Updated thread persistence documentation with comprehensive instructions for project continuity.

## Version 2.0.0 (April 3, 2025)

### Major Features

#### Visual Enhancements
- **Enhanced Pixel Visualization System**: Implemented sophisticated emotional expressions with seven distinct states (joy, reflective, curious, excited, empathetic, calm, neutral) and fluid animations that respond to conversation context.
- **Dynamic Background System**: Added multiple background types (starfield, particles, gradient shifts, waves) that adapt to conversation context and user interactions.
- **Theme System**: Created five customizable visual styles (default, dark, light, cosmic, nature) that affect all visual components with real-time switching.
- **Interface Animation System**: Implemented smooth transitions and visual feedback for user interactions with six animation types (fade, slide, scale, pulse, shake, bounce).
- **Accessibility System**: Added comprehensive accessibility features including high contrast mode, large text mode, color blindness accommodations, enhanced focus indicators, and reduced motion options.

#### Conversation Enhancements
- **Advanced Contextual Memory System**: Implemented multi-level memory structure (short-term, medium-term, long-term) that maintains conversation context across sessions with fact storage and retrieval.
- **Natural Conversation Flow**: Added dynamic response timing, contextual follow-ups, and adaptive conversation styles for more human-like interactions.
- **Emotional Intelligence Framework**: Implemented sophisticated emotion detection and response generation for more empathetic interactions.

#### Audio Enhancements
- **Multi-layered Ambient Soundscapes**: Created four distinct soundscape types (cosmic, nature, meditation, urban) with layered audio structure that changes intermittently.
- **Interaction Sound Effects**: Added comprehensive sound categories for UI interactions, feedback, conversation events, and ambient interactions.
- **Voice Enhancement System**: Implemented multiple voice options with emotional inflection and dynamic speech characteristics.

#### Utility Enhancements
- **Event System**: Created a robust publish-subscribe system for component communication.
- **Storage Manager**: Implemented persistent data storage with multiple backends.
- **User Personalization System**: Added comprehensive user preference management.

### Infrastructure Improvements
- **Modular Architecture**: Restructured codebase with clear separation of concerns for improved maintainability.
- **Comprehensive Testing Environment**: Created dedicated test environment for component and integration testing.
- **Improved Documentation**: Added detailed implementation documentation, thread persistence documentation, and user guides.
